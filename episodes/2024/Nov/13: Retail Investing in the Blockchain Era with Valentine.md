This week Chives and John were joined by Valentine, a Stellar community member and contributor who is becoming increasingly involved in the online advocacy space and is providing code improvements to the SDEX ecosystem. Valentine has some personal history as a retail investor and engaging with online communities, and was unfamiliar with DRS as an asset holding framework, so we covered some of these topics as well.
