This week on Taking Stock, we're speaking at length with John Wooten about his suggestions and work to see regulators update and modernize their approach to transfer agents. John is a hyperqualified person to speak with about these developments, as between his Transfer Agent BlockTransfer and his self-developed code concept TAD3, he is among the few pushing for meaningful under-the-hood changes in the TA industry.
