# Taking Stock Episode 55: 2024 Review and Looking Ahead

Hey all! Today we'll be taking stock of our progress this past year, and taking a look forward at what 2025 may look like. From porting our database infrastructure to GitHub and becoming the first American DUNA, there have been some awesome advancements. I'm looking forward to also discussing items on the near horizon, such as the hopeful approval to come for WhyDRS to operate as a charitable nonprofit. @wtfeweguys will join the show to talk about social engagement and scaling project development, leveraging what we have to grow what we can do. This will also be the last episode of 2024, as we break for the winter holiday. Be well and be merry!
