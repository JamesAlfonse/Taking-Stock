# _Taking Stock_ Community Portal

Welcome to a collaborative place to ideate, formalize, and influence our weekly [podcast discussions](https://linktr.ee/takingstockpodcast)!

This repo can be a home for introducing anything you'd like covered, highlighted, or otherwise brought into our ongoing dialogues.

The final episodes get added to [this RSS feed](https://github.com/Taking-Stock/RSSfeed), potentially with links to our collective writen details here.

For the upcoming schedule, see the `episodes` folder. For community brainstorming, explore the repo's `pending-ideas` and community discussions (above).

## IPFS Pinning

IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) is a decentralized way to store and share files where everyone helps host the data, making it more robust and efficient than traditional, single-server websites.

The way it works is when you add a file to IPFS, it's split into smaller pieces, each with its own unique address. When someone wants the file, the network locates and gathers these pieces from different computers, reassembling them seamlessly.

Pinning a file means your node (computer) is instructed to permanently store all its blocks, ensuring they remain available and aren’t removed during routine cleanup.

For volunteers interested in preserving and hosting Taking Stock episodes, here are some instructions on how to pin episodes onto your machine through IPFS.

## Step 1: Download IPFS

Visit [the official IPFS Github](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-desktop) and download the desktop client for your operating system. Once installed, open it and you should see something similar to the screenshot below.

## Step 2: Search the most recent hash

The most recent hash is available at the top of this page; copy the hash, then paste it into the search bar as shown below and press “Enter”.

## Step 3: Press the three dots and select “Set pinning”

Each file will need to be pinned separately when using the desktop client.

## Step 4: Pin to local node

Check the box next to “Local node” and then press apply to pin an item.

## Step 5: Repeat the process

Once you are finished pinning the files, you should eventually see a pin icon next to the files that are pinned. Success!
